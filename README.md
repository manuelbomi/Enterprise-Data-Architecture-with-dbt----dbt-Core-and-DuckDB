# Enterprise Data Architecture with dbt (dbt Core + DuckDB)

##### This repository demonstrates a small but production-patterned dbt project using **dbt Core** with **DuckDB** for local development and testing. 

##### The goal is to show how dbt enables **reliable, repeatable, and governed** SQL pipelines that scale from local prototyping (DuckDB) to full enterprise warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, etc).
